            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Graces of the 12th of <hi>November</hi> I received to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of that Month, and was not a little ſurprized, after being threatned above a year with your Graces Anſwer to the <hi>Obſervations and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on my Lord</hi> Caſtle-Haven<hi>'s Memoires,</hi> which your Grace takes notice you had ſeen above a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; to find them only moſt ſatyrically burleſqued, and my intentions in the writing of them moſt unnaturally miſinterpreted and misjudged, without giving inſtance of any one particular, which could ſo much tranſport your Grace, or intereſt you to judge of a Letter of mine to another, with ſo invective heat and miſtake.</p>
            <p>Your Graces Letter therefore conſiſting only of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, I can no otherwiſe adapt my Anſwer, (after a moſt ſerious reviſion of my Book upon this occaſion) but by giving the reverſe of your Graces ſtrain'd and erroneous Affirmatives by my plain and true Negatives, till your Grace shall adminiſter occaſion, by communicating the particular Animadverſions your Grace hath been (as I hear) ſo long about.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons leading your Grace to believe it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I could be the Author of that Diſcourſe, I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, though they import a fair Opinion of me; and that in the beginning of your Letter your Grace had better thoughts than when your Hand was in and heated.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:184325:3"/>
            <p>I do therefore abſolutely deny that I affirm any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact poſitively in that Book, which are eaſily or authentically (or at all) to be diſproved.</p>
            <p>Or that from thoſe Matters of Fact, groſly miſtaken, it deduces Conſequences, raiſes Inferences, and ſcatters Glances injurious to the memory of the dead, and the Honour of ſome living; among which your Grace finds your ſelf worſt treated.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, your Graces unjuſt Inferences from the time of its Writing, and the misjudging the deſign of the Author, give no countenance or occaſion to your Graces Rhetorical Character of the Times, though I joyn in all, but the Opinion your Grace ſeems to have taken up that there is a Plot, (other than that of the Papiſts) to deſtroy the Crown and Church; a Diſcovery worthy the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if your Grace knows, and believes what you write; but how I am concerned to have it mentioned to me, I know not, your Grace can beſt tell what you intend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſinuate thereby.</p>
            <p>Theſe are your Graces Reaſons why you were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to believe that Book to be of my Compoſing; yet you cannot leave me without a ſting, in your expreſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whether I should imitate ſuborned Libellers, or they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, would be all one for my Reputation; becauſe I were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184325:3"/>me in the ſecond: Your Grace will want Inſtances in both, except this of your own making; and therefore there muſt be ſome other reaſon why your Grace did not believe (if really you did not) that Diſcourſe to be of my compoſure.</p>
            <p>But this admitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r truth (as it is undoubtedly), your Grace in the next place calls the World to judge whether Pen, Ink and Paper are not dangerous Tools in my hands.</p>
            <p>I remember the Times, when they were ſerviceable to the Kings Reſtoration, and conſtant Service of the Crown, or craved in aid by your Grace, that you did not account them ſo; and it is much to my ſafety that they are not ſo in your Graces Hands, though I find them as sharp there as in any mans alive.</p>
            <p>Your Grace being at length aſſured I was the Author, your next care was to ſpend ſome thoughts to vindicate Truth, the late King, your ſelf, your Actions and Family, all reflected upon, and traduced (as your Grace is pleaſed to fancy) by that Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>But your Grace had no cauſe to trouble your thoughts with ſuch Vindications, unleſs you could shew where in that Book they are reflected upon and traduced, no ſuch thing occurring to me (upon the ſtricteſt reviſal) nor ever shall be objected to me with Juſtice and Truth.</p>
            <p>After your Grace hath brought it to the <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> (where I believe it never was till your Grace prefered it to that Office) and where you have doomed it to expire, as Writings of that nature and force uſe (you ſay) to do (for which I shall not be at all concerned) you reſted without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:184325:4"/>troubling your ſelf or any body elſe with Animadverſions upon my miſtakes, which your Grace is pleaſed to ſay are ſo many and ſo obvious (though you name none, nor do they occur to others) that you wonder how I could fall into them.</p>
            <p>If your Grace believe your ſelf in this, you ſeem to have forgot the long time you ſpent in conſidering and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverting upon that deſpicable Pamphlet, with your Labours whereon I was threatned by ſome of your Graces Relations for many months; and your Grace hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the delay, by the virulent general Reflections you have now ſent me, which yet I doubt not will evaporate or shrink to nothing, when your Grace shall ſeek for Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to back them, whereof if you can find any, I claim in Juſtice they may be ſent me.</p>
            <p>Your Grace adds, that you have been in expectation that by this time my compleat Hiſtory would have come forth; wherein (if you may judge by the pattern) your Grace ſaith, you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that neither the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject nor your ſelf will be more juſtly dealt with than in that occaſional Eſſay; and therefore offer me all the helps of Authentick Commiſſions, Tranſactions and Papers your Grace is poſſeſſed of, whereof you inform me none hath more.</p>
            <p>This is an anticipating Jealouſie, which no man living can have ground for; and when my Hiſtory shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated (which is now delayed for thoſe Aſſiſtances your Grace is ſo well able, and ſo freely offers to afford me) tho' my Weakneſs may be expoſed, my Integrity and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:184325:4"/>shall appear, and your unjuſt ſuſpicion will, I doubt not, ceaſe, if Truth may be welcome to you, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one of the dangerous Inſtruments in my Hand; by which having incurred your Anger and Enmity in the firſt Eſſay; I have ſlender hopes to be more acceptable in the ſecond; though I reſolve to hold to the firſt approved Law of a good and faithful Hiſtorian, which is, That he should not dare to ſay any thing that is falſe; and that he dare not but ſay any thing that is true, that there be not ſo much as ſuſpicion of favour or hatred in his Writing.</p>
            <p>And this might give a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to your Graces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Appeal, before a <hi>Gravamen;</hi> though I never intended, by relating the truth of things paſt, to become a Judge of your Graces or any other mans actions, but barely <hi>Res geſtas narrare,</hi> for the information, correction, and inſtruction of this Age and Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Your Grace deſiring to know to what particular parts of my Hiſtory I would have Information, I shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only mention theſe.</p>
            <p>The Intrigues of the Ceſſation, and Commiſſions for them and the two Peaces of 1646. and 1648. forced upon the King by the Rebellious <hi>Irish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The grounds and tranſactions about depriving Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parſons</hi> from being one of the Lords Juſtices, and then diſmiſſing him, Sir <hi>Adam Loftus</hi> Vice-Treaſurer, Sir <hi>John Temple</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Meredith</hi> Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer, &amp;c.</hi> from the Council-Table.</p>
            <p>The Myſtery of <hi>Glamorgan</hi>'s Peace, and his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:184325:5"/>
            <p>The ſeveral ungrateful Expulſions of your Grace by the Confederate <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paſſages concerning the Parliaments Preſent of a Jewel to your Grace.</p>
            <p>The Battels, Reliefs, Sieges, and chief Encounters in your Graces time.</p>
            <p>The Proceedings between your Grace and the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Aſſembly of the Clergy in 1666. with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for their Sitting.</p>
            <p>The Plot for ſurprizing the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in which <hi>Warren</hi> and others were, with the Examinations, and what Offenders were executed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And any thing elſe your Grace judgeth of import to have conveyed to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Other parts of the Hiſtory shall be propoſed to your Grace in my Progreſs, and before I put my laſt Hand to it, with a reſolution, that though I may have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſtaken in Judgment: yet as I never did promote the report of a Matter of Fact which I knew to be falſe, ſo I never would.</p>
            <p>Which I am induced the rather to mention, becauſe your Grace ſaith, you had rather help to prevent, than to detect Errors.</p>
